# Introduction
This is currently very much a work in progress, and there is much that will be cleaned up and added over time. The goal of this suite is to
abstract many of the common tasks related to managing cloud infrastructure in AWS and bridge the gap
between raw infrastructure management tools like the EC2 command line tools, and configuration management tools. Initially, this tool
is focused on EBS volume, raid and snapshot management of single and raid volumes, but going forward the goal is to cover other infrastructure management needs
that are not fully addressed by other tools.

## Current Features
EBS Volumes (managed as groups of volumes)
* Manages groups of one or more ebs volumes as if they were a single volume and handles the underlying group operations for all of the following  
    * Create
    * Delete
    * Attach
    * Detach
    * Automatically creates and configures software raid for multi-volume groups when creating new volume groups
    * Partition and format new volume
    * Mount volume group
    * Unmount volume group
* Internally handles all of the metadata associated with the raid volume configuration, so that when a volume group is attached to an instance, the raid is automatically assembled and system configured
* Raid support currently requires that `mdadm` package be installed on the destination system
* Partitioning and formatting require that `mkfs.FILESYSTEM` is available on the system for `FILESYSTEM`, eg. `mkfs.ext3` normally exists on most distributions, but `mkfs.xfs` is only available after installing `xfsprogs`

EBS Snapshots (managed as groups of snapshots)
* Pre/post snapshot hooks to enable running commands/scripts on target host before and after starting snapshot to ensure consistent point in time snapshot of all volumes in a raid group
* Copy snapshot group to another region (only handled internally currently for cloning a snapshot group into a volume group in another region)
* Clone snapshot group to new volume group and optionally attach/mount on a host
* Clone latest snapshot of a volume group or host/instance + mount point
* Schedule regular snapshots of volume/raid with managed grandfather/father/son expiration
* Automatable purging of expired snapshots

Instance Management
* Instances can be created using `ams host create`
* Templates for host creation can be managed using `ams host template ...` functionality
    * `ams host create` accepts a template id or template name when creating an instance, allowing you to create a new instance or set of instance with only a single command line option
* Instance discovery has been implemented, allowing the host information to be automatically populated
* Regions and availability_zones information imported into AMS database 
* Support for viewing the available key pairs for launching instances
* Support for viewing the available AMIs for instances (only currently pulls private AMIs)

Route53
* Discovery has been implemented to synchronize the local database with the current state of Route53 DNS records and health checks
* Create raw DNS record
* Create DNS record for a specific host without explicitly defining a number of the parameters that are on the host (optionally also configure a Route53 health check for the host)
* Create Route53 health checks
* Support for managing Simple, Weighted Round Robin, Failover, and Latency routing policies in Route53 records
* Delete DNS record

Instance Tagging
* Management of instance tags is supported with ability to add/edit/remove tags on single hosts or many with advanced tag based filtering
    * Tags are used by `ams-inventory` to provide groups for hosts in ansible. 
* A number of operations now allow actions of commands to be filtered by tags
* Integration of tagging into host creation and templates

Networking
* Discovery has been implemented to gather the information on security groups and their association across all regions
* Tools for viewing security groups 
* Integration of security groups into host creation and templating

VPC
* Discovery has been implemented to gather data about VPCs and their subnets
* Tools for viewing VPCs and subnets
* Integration of VPCs and subnets into host creation and templates

[Ansible Integration](#cms_integration)
* A dynamic inventory script has been added that uses the data in the AMS database to power your inventory needs for ansible
* Dynamic inventory supports managing server group hierarchies (groups of groups and groups of servers)
* Built in templating for combining tags on hosts into group names and adding hosts to these groups automatically
    * Templating support includes filtering so that templates can apply to hosts with specific tag values
* Command line management of groups and templates using same script that ansible uses as inventory

SSH client
* Password or private key based login
* Handles sudo login (password or passwordless)
* Captures stdout, stderr and exit code from command run

## Change Log
Changes that are made are now being tracked in the [CHANGELOG](CHANGELOG.md)

## Setup and Configuration
### Initial installation
* This tool will only work on systems with python 2.6+ (due to paramiko requirements), but to date has only been tested on 2.6.6 and 2.7.6 but should run on any 2.6.x or 2.7.x version (3.x compatibility is unlikely). If you find that it specifically does or does not work on any version please let me know and I will add it to this list.
* The tool requires ssh and sudo access to hosts in order to accomplish tasks like mounting volumes and running system commands to start/stop services (for snapshots)
* Copy defaults.ini to /etc/ams.ini or ~/ams.ini and edit AWS, SSH and SUDO access credentials
* A MySQL database needs to be setup for tracking state. The following statements assume that the mysql database and the tool are located on the same host:
    * `CREATE DATABASE ams;` -- Create the schema
    * `CREATE USER 'ams_user'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED WITH mysql_native_password BY 'ams_pass';`
    * `GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON ams.* TO 'ams_user'@'localhost';` -- (This will give access to the new schema created)
* Edit TRACKING_DB credentials in your ams.ini file with the proper credentials for your MySQL database (default settings are configured to match the above grant with standard mysql install)
* `pip install -r requirements.txt` will install the handful of external dependencies
    * You have option of either running pip install as root or if you have setup a virtualenv for this tool, then you you can run pip install without root in the virtual environment
    * Documentation on setting the tool up with virtualenv is planned for the future
    * Troubleshooting mac with homebrew mysql install:
        * If you run into an issue with installing mysql-python that gives an error like `fatal error: 'my_config.h' file not found` you can do the following to fix it: 
```
brew install mysql
brew unlink mysql
brew install mysql-connector-c
sed -i -e 's/libs="$libs -l "/libs="$libs -lmysqlclient -lssl -lcrypto"/g' /usr/local/bin/mysql_config
pip install requirements.txt
brew unlink mysql-connector-c
brew link --overwrite mysql
```
* Suggested: add the path to ams directory to your path or add symlink to `ams` script to a directory in the system path
* `ams internals database install` will create the current full version of all of the tables

#### Config file priority
In order from highest to lowest priority:
* Environment variables: AMS_*
* Values in user's config file (~/ams.ini)
* Values in global config file (/etc/ams.ini)
* Legacy configuration values (settings.py)
* Values in default config file (defaults.ini)
* Database values

    Note: User, global, and default configuration ini files are mutually exclusive 
        so only one will be loaded. Priority order is user, global, default with 
        user having highest priority. This may change to an override model in the 
        future if a compelling reason is found.

### Enabling bash/zsh completion
This project makes use of the argcomplete library (https://github.com/kislyuk/argcomplete) to provide dynamic completion. As part of the pip installation,
the library will be installed, but completion will still need to be enabled. Due to some multi-platform issues I experienced trying to enable global completeion,
I opted to use specific completion. For bash you only need to add the following to your .bashrc, .profile or .bash_profile (depending on which your OS uses) and then reload
your terminal or `source .bashrc` (or .profile/.bash_profile).

    eval "$(register-python-argcomplete ams)"
    eval "$(register-python-argcomplete ams-inventory)"

For zsh run the following: `activate-global-python-argcomplete --user`
Then add the following to the end of your .zshrc file:

    autoload bashcompinit
    bashcompinit
    source ~/.bash_completion.d/python-argcomplete.sh
    eval "$(register-python-argcomplete ams)"
    eval "$(register-python-argcomplete ams-inventory)"

_**Note:** You may need to install argcomplete globally using `sudo pip install argcomplete` to support autocomplete from the shell._

### Upgrading
If you have updated the code base, just run `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install any new dependencies and run `ams internals database upgrade` to run the update scripts
for the database tables. Upgrade scripts can be run as often as you like, as it will do nothing if the database version matches the code version. If the database version is not
in sync with the current version defined in the tool, the tool will not allow any operations to be done until the internals database is upgraded; this is avoid the possiblity of
corrupting data in the database due to expectations in the software.



# AMS Management Tool Usage

## General
All of the functionality is through the command line tool `ams`. It has been implemented as a multi-level nested command parser using the argparse module.<br>
If at any point you need help just add `-h` or `--help` flag to the command line and it will list all available sub-commands and options for the current command level.<br>
There are still a few legacy command structures that need to be cleaned up, so there may be some minor changes to the syntax to a few of these, but I will attempt to keep 
these to an absolute minimum. The option `-q` or  `--scriptable-output` can be passed after `ams` but before any of the subcommands to change the output into a tab delimited 
format rather than a structured table that many functions display; this is to aid in writing shell scripts using AMS. Eg. `ams -q host list` will output the same data as 
`ams host list` but it will be formatted as tab delimited, and no headers or footers will be displayed. 


## Host/Instance
#### `ams host list [SEARCH_FIELD] [SEARCH_VALUE]`
With no options this lists all host entries in the database. Filtering can be done on host, instance_id, and name properties by 
providing a `SEARCH_FIELD` and `SEARCH_VALUE`. Wildcard matching can be done on these properties by passing `--like` (`SEARCH_FIELD` 
contains `LIKE`) and `--prefix` (`SEARCH_FIELD` starts with `PREFIX`). Filtering can also be done on the availability zone that the 
instance is in using `--zone`, this is a prefix match as well. 

Hosts can also be filtered by the tags on the instances by passing one or more 
`--tag` options with the value of them in the form `--tag tagname<OPERATOR>value`, eg. `--tag env=prod` will match hosts that have a tag 
named "env" with value of "prod; conversely `--tag env!=prod` will match hosts that do not have an "env" tag with the value "prod". Support for 
prefix and contains matching can be achieved with the `=:` and `=~` type operators respectively along with their negated versions.

Arguments:

      --like LIKE           string to find within 'search-field'
      --prefix PREFIX       string to prefix match against 'search-field'
      --zone ZONE           Availability zone to filter results by. This is a
                            prefix search so any of the following is valid with
                            increasing specificity: 'us', 'us-west', 'us-west-2',
                            'us-west-2a'
      -x, --extended        Show extended information on hosts
      -a, --all             Include terminated instances (that have been added via
                            discovery)
      --terminated          Show only terminated instances (that have been added
                            via discovery)
      -s, --show-tags       Display tags for instances
      -t TAG, --tag TAG     Filter instances by tag, in the form name<OPERATOR>value.
                            Valid operators: 
                                =	(equal)
                                !=	(not equal)
                                =~	(contains/like)
                                !=~	(not contains/not like)
                                =:	(prefixed by)
                                !=:	(not prefixed by)
                            Eg. To match Name tag containing 'foo': --tag Name=~foo

----

#### `ams host create`
Create new instance(s) with the givens settings. The cli completions for many of the options are contextual based on options that have been 
provided up to the point that completion is being done. Providing region will help filter zone, ami-id, vpc-id and security-group; providing 
zone will help filter subnet-id; providing vpc-id will help filter security-group and subnet-id. Example: `ams host create --region us-west-2 --zone <TAB><TAB>` 
will give autocomplete options only for zones that are in region already given.
 
Using --template-id or --template-name, a template can be defined for the instance creation. The set of required arguments is the same, but 
depending on the configuration of the template, some or all of these requirements may be fulfilled such that the only option that is required 
to create an instance is a template-id or template-name. Any options passed in addition to the template identifier will override values in the 
template with the exception of tags and security groups. Security groups will be combined into the union of the security groups defined in the 
template and the ones provided as arguments. Tags will be combined as the union of all tag names along with their corresponding values, and in 
the case of a conflict on tag name the value that is passed as an argument will be used. Contextual command line autocomplete also takes into 
account the values for a template (overriding template context with passed arguments) when doing completions.

----

#### `ams host template create`
Create a new host creation template. The only absolutely required argument is a unique template name. Any of the fields that 
are provided in the template, but are required for host creation, must be provided at when running `ams host create`. --tag 
and --security-group can be provided multiple times to add multiple tags and security groups respectively.

Required Arguments: --template-name

Arguments:

      -n TEMPLATE_NAME, --template-name TEMPLATE_NAME
                            Unique name for the template
      -r REGION, --region REGION
                            Region to create the instance in
      -y INSTANCE_TYPE, --instance-type INSTANCE_TYPE
                            EC2 instance type
      -m AMI_ID, --ami-id AMI_ID
                            AMI ID for the new instance
      -k KEY_NAME, --key-name KEY_NAME
                            Keypair name to use for creating instance
      -z ZONE, --zone ZONE  Availability zone to create the instance in
      -o, --monitoring      Enable detailed cloudwatch monitoring
      -v VPC_ID, --vpc-id VPC_ID
                            VPC ID (Not required, used to aid autocomplete for
                            subnet id)
      -s SUBNET_ID, --subnet-id SUBNET_ID
                            Subnet ID for VPC
      -i PRIVATE_IP, --private-ip PRIVATE_IP
                            Private IP address to assign to instance (VPC only)
      -g SECURITY_GROUP, --security-group SECURITY_GROUP
                            Security group to associate with instance (supports
                            multiple usage)
      -e, --ebs-optimized   Enable EBS optimization
      -a NAME, --name NAME  Set the name tag for created instance
      -t TAG, --tag TAG     Add tag to the instance in the form tagname=tagvalue,
                            eg: --tag my_tag=my_value (supports multiple usage)

----

#### `ams host template edit`
Comparable to create for most options, except that template-id or template-name is required to identify the template for editing 
and the addition of the arguments: --remove, --remove-tag, --remove-security-group. --remove allows you to clear the value for the 
given field so that the template no longer will provide a value for it. --remove-tag and --remove-security-group are for disassociating
host tags and security groups respectively from a template so that those will no longer be auto added to newly created instances using 
the template. --remove* arguments can each be provided multiple times as well. Note: when applying edits to a template, remove operations 
are applied before add operations, eg: `ams host template edit --template-id 1 --remove-tag foo --tag foo=something` will remove tag `foo`

#### `ams snapshot schedule list [resource] [resource_id]`
Lists the snapshot schedules based on a specific resource id. `resource` is one of the literals `host`, `instance`, `volume`
and `resource_id` is either hostname, instance_id, or volume_group_d respectively.<br>
If no arguments are provided, then it will list all snapshot schedules


Arguments:

      --like LIKE           search string to use when listing resources
      --prefix PREFIX       search string prefix to use when listing resources

----

#### `ams snapshot schedule add host (hostname)`
Schedule snapshots for a host + mount point. This is the most flexible of the snapshot scheduling methods as it will resolve
the host and mount point to do snapshots and will not be affected if the instance or the volume group are changed on a host.<br>
Interval settings affect how often a snapshot is performed/retained. eg. 2 for hourly will take an "hourly" snapshot every other hour,
2 for daily will take a "daily" snapshot every other day.<br>
Retain settings affect how many of each type of snapshot to keep. eg. 24 for hours will keep the last 24 "hourly" snapshots
(not necessarily the last 24 hours if "hourly" interval is not 1). Setting the retain value for any of the types to 0 disables that one.<br>
If `--intervals` or `--retentions` are set, they will override the single `int_*` and `ret_*` arguments<br>
PRE and POST are commands that will be run before and after the snapshot, and provide a means to ensure that data is in a consistent state before
snapshotting and revert back to normal operation after snapshot has begun.<br>

----

#### `ams snapshot schedule add instance (instance_id)`
Schedule snapshots for an instance + mount point. This is more flexible than the volume group id based snapshot, but if the instance
for a host is replaced, then the snapshot may not be able to run.<br>
Interval settings affect how often a snapshot is performed/retained. eg. 2 for hourly will take an "hourly" snapshot every other hour,
2 for daily will take a "daily" snapshot every other day.<br>
Retain settings affect how many of each type of snapshot to keep. eg. 24 for hours will keep the last 24 "hourly" snapshots

----

#### `ams snapshot schedule add volume (volume_group_id)`
Schedule snapshots for a specific volume_group_id. Least flexible of all the schedule creations, as it will only snapshot
the volume group it is assigned to do. If the volume group is no longer in use, snapshots will continue to be created.<br>
`int_*` settings affect how often a snapshot is performed/retained. eg. 2 for hourly will take an "hourly" snapshot every other hour,
2 for daily will take a "daily" snapshot every other day.<br>
`ret_*` settings affect how many of each type of snapshot to keep. eg. 24 for hours will keep the last 24 "hourly" snapshots

#### `ams snapshot schedule edit (schedule_id)`
Edit an existing snapshot schedule by schedule_id.<br>
`int_*` settings affect how often a snapshot is performed/retained. eg. 2 for hourly will take an "hourly" snapshot every other hour,
2 for daily will take a "daily" snapshot every other day.<br>
`ret_*` settings affect how many of each type of snapshot to keep. eg. 24 for hours will keep the last 24 "hourly" snapshots
(not necessarily the last 24 hours if "hourly" interval is not 1). Setting the retain value for any of the types to 0 disables that one.<br>
If `--intervals` or `--retentions` are set, they will override the single `int_*` and `ret_*` arguments as well as overwrite all the single
settings in the database. If you only want to update a single setting, use the single versions of the arguments<br>
PRE and POST are commands that will be run before and after the snapshot, and provide a means to ensure that data is in a consistent state before
snapshotting and revert back to normal operation after snapshot has begun.<br>
Description is written as metadata to the snapshot itself and will show up in the EC2 console. Changing the description does not update the
descriptions on snapshots that have already been created; it only changes the description for new snapshots going forward<br>
At this time, changing a snapshot schedule from volume/host/instance type to any other type is not supported. Delete the current schedule
and add a new one with different type but the same settings to achieve this functionality.

This is intended to be dropped into a cron on a single host every hour with no arguments. <br>
If a `schedule_id` is provided then the snapshot for the schedule points to will be created immediately regardless of whether it is scheduled (with a best
effort to apply the retention rules so the snapshot will eventually be cleaned up). Take note that if a valid expiry time can be calculated the
snapshot will be automatically purged per the rules of the schedule. If you want a snapshot that will not expire use `ams snapshot create` to create a snapshot.

### Route53
#### `ams route53 discovery`
Reads the Route53 dns configurations and maps the hostnames defined in dns to the hosts in the hosts table. Currently this will pull all the records from dns down
to the database, but it only uses A and CNAME records to assign hostnames to hosts. This will not traverse recursive CNAMEs currently (or likely ever), and as a
general rule it will prefer an A record over a CNAME (I am open to arguments for/against this and any suggestions).

Arguments:

      --interactive         Enable interactive mode for applying discovered host
                            names to hosts (not enabled yet)
      --prefer {internal,external}
                            Sets which hostname gets preference if DNS records are
                            defined for an internal address and an external
                            address
      --load-only           Only load the route53 tables, but do not apply
                            hostname changes to hosts

#### `ams route53 list dns`
Lists the DNS records that are currently in the database. You can run `ams route53 discovery` to synchronize the database
with what is currently configured in Route53

Arguments:

----

#### `ams route53 list zones`
Lists the hosted zones that are currently in the database. You can run `ams route53 discovery` to synchronize the database
with what is currently configured in Route53

Arguments:

----

#### `ams route53 list healthchecks`
Lists the Route53 health checks that are currently in the database. You can run `ams route53 discovery` to synchronize the
database with what is currently configured in Route53

Arguments:

----

#### `ams route53 dns create (fqdn) (record_type)`
Create a raw DNS record in Route53. Note that currently this tool only supports single value DNS entries (ie. no support
for multiple values in a single DNS record). fqdn is the fully qualified domain name for the entry. You can include the trailing dot(.)
or it will be added automatically. record_type is the dns record type. Currently only support values `a` or `cname` for A record or
CNAME record respectively.

----

## Internals
#### `ams internals database install`
This will install the database table for an initial install of AMS.

----

#### `ams internals database upgrade`
This should be run every time that the software is updated to ensure that database schema matches the application's expectation.

----

#### `ams internals config list`
With no arguments, this will display the current value in the database for all of the config variables. Passing --active displays 
the same config variables, but the values for all of the variables are pulled from the active running configuration (after all config 
sources are processed).

Arguments:

      -a, --active  Show the full active config rather than the values that are in
                    the database

----

#### `ams internals config update (name) [value]`
Update the value of the `name` variable to `value`. `value` is required unless using the --clear option to clear the value.

Required Arguments: name, value|--clear

Arguments:

      --clear     Clear the value in the database for the config variable

# CMS Integrations
==================

## General

The goal of AMS is not to replace standard configuration management systems (like puppet, chef, ansible, salt, etc), but rather to 
augment these systems and provide tools that are missing or may be particularly cumbersome to use in the context of a CMS. CMSes are 
particularly well suited for managing software configurations on hosts, but management of hardware (or virtualized hardware) in these 
is limited. Most now support starting/stopping/terminating an instance but lack more advanced features for managing and tracking the other 
components of the virtualized hardware infrastructure (storage, networking, etc).  

AMS is a growing set of tools for managing virtual hardware, and in the process, it is also developing into a virtual hardware CMDB. The AMS 
database now keeps track of enough information about EC2 infrastructure to use this data to begin integrating with other CMSes. 


## Ansible Integration
AMS now comes with a command line tool: `ams-inventory`. This script implements the `--list` and `--host` options required for an 
ansible dynamic inventory file and outputs json in ansible's [dynamic inventory format](http://docs.ansible.com/intro_dynamic_inventory.html).

To use ams-inventory with ansible commands just pass the path to ams-inventory with the `-i/--inventory` flag. Eg: `ansible -i /path/to/ams-inventory -m ping`


### `ams-inventory` Options and Features

Arguments:

      -h, --help            show this help message and exit
      --list                Lists all of the hosts in ansible dynamic inventory
                            format
      --host HOST           lists the hostvars for a single instance
      --list-groups         List the additional configured groups for dynamic
                            inventory
      --list-tag-templates  Lists the configured group tagging templates
      --add-tag-template TEMPLATE
                            Add a new group tagging template. Eg. In the case of a
                            server that is tagged with the tags env=stage and
                            role=webserver and a template that is defined as
                            '{{env}}-{{role}}', the dynamic inventory will add the
                            host to a group with the name 'stage-webserver'. The
                            template tags can also be filtered using the syntax
                            '{{name=value}}'. Eg. a template
                            '{{env=stage}}-{{role}}' would be applied to a host
                            with env=stage and role=webserver, but not a host with
                            env=prod and role=webserver.
      --edit-tag-template TEMPLATE_ID TEMPLATE
                            Edit an existing group tagging template
      --delete-tag-template TEMPLATE_ID
                            Delete a tag template
      --add-group GROUP_NAME [CHILD_NAME [CHILD_NAME] ...]
                            Add a new inventory group with name GROUP_NAME.
                            Optionally include the child groups for GROUP_NAME.
                            Note: this is an additive operation rather than
                            replacement operation.
      --delete-group GROUP_NAME
                            Remove an inventory group and its mapping of children
      --remove-group-children GROUP_NAME [CHILD_NAME [CHILD_NAME] ...]
                            Remove one or more children from a group


#### Features

* Automatic addition of instances to groups based on the following:
    * Tags on instances in the form `NAME_VALUE`, this includes AWS tags and AMS extended tags but not AMS hostvars type tags
    * AWS Region
    * AWS Availability Zone
    * VPC ID
    * Subnet ID (VPC subnet)
    * AMI ID
    * Instance Type (m1.small, c3.xlarge, etc)
    * Name of instance (value of the Name tag on an instance)
* Automatic addition of mappings for Route53 entries to hosts
* Management of static group hierarchies that are included in the dynamic inventory
* Management of templates that are applied to an instance's tags to include instance in a group

----

### Display Dynamic Inventory and Host Variables
Ansible passes the `--list` option when executing ams-inventory to fetch the full dynamic inventory.Ansible typically 
passes `--host HOSTNAME` to a dynamic inventory script to retrieve the hostvars for a host, but since this data included in the 
primary dynamic inventory document, ansible does not use it. It is included for completeness and as a user tool to look at the 
variables for a host.

----

### Static Group Hierarchy Management
Static group hierarchies are equivalent to the `[group:children]` constructs in ansible inventory files. These hierarchies 
can be managed in ams-inventory, ansible static inventory files, or a mix of both using ansible's ability to use a directory 
path as the value for `-i/--inventory` option (there must be a script that executes ams-inventory or a symlink to ams-inventory 
in the directory with the static inventory files). Groups can be a parent, a child, or both at once, as nested parent=&gt;child 
relationships are supported. 


#### `ams-inventory --list-groups`
Displays a table of the currently configured group hierarchies

**Example:**

    $> ams-inventory --list-groups
    
    Inventory Groups:
    +--------------------+--------------------+
    | Group              | Children           |
    +--------------------+--------------------+
    | loadbalancer       | prod-loadbalancer  |
    |                    | stage-loadbalancer |
    |                    |                    |
    | prod               | prod-loadbalancer  |
    |                    | prod-webserver     |
    |                    |                    |
    | prod-loadbalancer  | ---                |
    |                    |                    |
    | prod-webserver     | ---                |
    |                    |                    |
    | stage              | stage-loadbalancer |
    |                    | stage-webserver    |
    |                    |                    |
    | stage-loadbalancer | ---                |
    |                    |                    |
    | stage-webserver    | ---                |
    |                    |                    |
    | webserver          | prod-webserver     |
    |                    | stage-webserver    |
    |                    |                    |
    +--------------------+--------------------+
    8 groups


_The above is equivalent to having an ansible inventory file with these definitions in it:_

    [prod:children]
    prod-loadbalancer
    prod-webserver
    
    [stage:children]
    stage-loadbalancer
    stage-webserver
    
    [webserver:children]
    prod-webserver
    stage-webserver
    
    [loadbalancer:children]
    prod-loadbalancer
    stage-loadbalancer

----

#### `ams-inventory --add-group GROUP_NAME [CHILD_NAME [CHILD_NAME [...]]]`
Add a new group to the groups table and optionally associates group with 1 or more child groups. The parent and child groups do not have 
to already exist when creating the mapping as they will be created if needed. This operation is an additive operation so if you 
already have a PARENT=&gt;CHILD_1 relationship and execute `ams-inventory --add-group PARENT CHILD_2` then you will now have both
mappings: PARENT=&gt;CHILD_1 and PARENT=&gt;CHILD_2

Required: GROUP_NAME

Optional: 1 or more CHILD_NAMEs 


**Example: Building the hierarchy defined in previous section using multiple different approaches to adding the relationships**

#### `ams-inventory --remove-group-children GROUP_NAME [CHILD_NAME [CHILD_NAME [...]]]`
Removes the relationship of 1 or more child groups with a parent group. This only removes the relationship, not the group 
entirely, use --delete-group to completely remove a group and all of its relationships.

**Example:**
    
    $> # remove a single child group from a parent
    $> ams-inventory --remove-group-children loadbalancer prod-loadbalancer
    Removed prod-loadbalancer from group loadbalancer

### Tag Templates and Dynamic Group Assignment
Templates can be defined that are applied to instance tags to create dynamic group names and add the instance to the dynamic 
groups. Templates have two different forms: a basic form that is applied to any host that has all the tags defined in the 
template and filtered templates that only apply to hosts that have all the tags and meet the required filter value(s). 


#### Basic Tag Templates
A tag template is simply a string that has any values that should be replaced by instance tags denoted by `{{TAG_NAME}}`

**Example:**
Given some hosts with the tags "env", "role" and "type", some examples of templates you could define are:

* `{{env}}-{{role}}-{{type}}`
* `{{env}}_{{role}}`
* `foo-{{env}}-{{type}}`

If you have 3 hosts with the following values for the tags:

* hostA
    * env = stage
    * role = webserver
    * type = api
* hostB 
    * env = production
    * role = database
    * type = primary
    * cluster = backup
* hostC
    * env = dev
    * role = webserver

These would be rendered into the following group names for the hosts:

* hostA
    * `stage-webserver-api`
    * `stage_webserver`
    * `foo-stage-api`
* hostB
    * `production-database-primary`
    * `production_database`
    * `foo-production-primary`
* hostC
    * N/A (not all values for the template are present)
    * `dev_webserver`
    * N/A (not all values for the template are present)

Each host will then be included in the groups for the templates that were fully rendered for that host.

---

#### Filtered Tag Templates
Filtered tag templates enable filtering of what hosts the templates get applied to based on the tag values. The format for 
filtered templates is `{{TAG_NAME=TAG_VALUE}}`

**Example:**
Given some hosts with the tags "env", "role" and "type", some examples of filtered templates you could define are:

* `{{env=production}}-{{role}}-{{type}}`
* `{{env=dev}}-{{role=database}}-combined`
* `{{env}}_{{role}}_{{type=api}}_deprecated`

If you have 3 hosts with the following values for the tags:

* hostA
    * env = dev
    * role = webserver
    * type = api
* hostB 
    * env = production
    * role = database
    * type = primary
    * cluster = backup
* hostC
    * env = dev
    * role = database
    * type = primary
    * cluster = backup

These would be rendered into the following group names for the hosts:

* hostA
    * N/A (env != production)
    * N/A (role != database)
    * `dev_webserver_api_deprecated`
* hostB
    * `production-database-primary`
    * N/A (env != production)
    * N/A (type != api)
* hostC
    * N/A (env != production)
    * `dev-database-combined`
    * N/A (type != api)

Each host will then be included in the groups for the templates that were fully rendered for that host.

---

#### `ams-inventory --list-tag-templates`
Displays a table of the currently configured tag templates. This table contains the template ID and the template and 
is sorted lexicographically by the contents of the template.

**Example:**

    $> ams-inventory --list-tag-templates
    
    Inventory Templates:
    +-------------+----------------------------------+
    | Template ID | Template                         |
    +-------------+----------------------------------+
    | 1           | {{env}}-{{role}}-{{role_type}}   |
    |             |                                  |
    | 12          | {{role=webserver}}-{{role_type}} |
    |             |                                  |
    +-------------+----------------------------------+
    2 templates


---

#### `ams-inventory --add-tag-template TEMPLATE`
Adds a new tag template to the database. `TEMPLATE` should be in the form of the above descriptions for basic and filtered 
templates. After the template is normalized and added, the final version of the template will be displayed.
 
**Example:**

    $> ams-inventory --add-tag-template '{{env=production}}-{{role}}-{{type}}'
    Template created
    
    Inventory Templates:
    +-------------+--------------------------------------+
    | Template ID | Template                             |
    +-------------+--------------------------------------+
    | 13          | {{env=production}}-{{role}}-{{type}} |
    |             |                                      |
    +-------------+--------------------------------------+
    1 templates
    
---

#### `ams-inventory --edit-tag-template TEMPLATE_ID TEMPLATE`
Adds a new tag template to the database. `TEMPLATE_ID` can be found using `ams-inventory --list-tag-templates` 
or from output of other operations. `TEMPLATE` should be in the form of the above descriptions for basic and filtered 
templates. After the template is normalized and added, the final version of the template will be displayed.
 
**Example:**

    $> ams-inventory --edit-tag-template 13 '{{env=dev}}-{{role}}-{{type}}'
    Template Updated
    
    Inventory Templates:
    +-------------+-------------------------------+
    | Template ID | Template                      |
    +-------------+-------------------------------+
    | 13          | {{env=dev}}-{{role}}-{{type}} |
    |             |                               |
    +-------------+-------------------------------+
    1 templates
    
---

#### `ams-inventory --delete-tag-template TEMPLATE_ID`
Deletes a tag template that is stored in the database. `TEMPLATE_ID` can be found using `ams-inventory --list-tag-templates` 
or from output of other operations.

**Example:**

    $> ams-inventory --delete-tag-template 13
    Template 13 deleted
